# task3fluttercalc

I started by create the design of the calculator, so i create the keyboard first I use column, sizedBox and buttonrow to put the information in the good place.

Next, I create the display with textend and adapt eight according to the number of digits. I put some style on the calculator and I finish the design.

Then, I continue by importing all the components and the packages I need to have to calculate. I create a models to add functions, change digits, clear the display, change the value when press some touch, calculate and print an error 'impossible to div per 0'... Unfortunatly, my % button doesn't work.
